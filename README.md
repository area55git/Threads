## Basic Mechanics
While *Threads* is pretty easy to mess around with and make fun drawings, if you ever want to try to make something more precise it would be to your advantage to understand a little about how the drawing engine actually works!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```
